# https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/15/03-list-less-than-ten.html
# Take a list, say for example this one:

#   a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

# Extras:

# Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
# Write this in one line of Python.
# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = []
liczba_uzytkowanika = int(input("Wypisz dowolna liczbe, wtedy otrzymasz liste liczb ktore sa mniejsze od wartosci jaka wpisales \n"))

for i in range (len(a)):    
    if a[i]<liczba_uzytkowanika:
        b.append(a[i])

print(b)

#2 print([nowa_lista for nowa_lista in a if nowa_lista<5])
